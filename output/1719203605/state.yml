synopsis_feedback_history:
- The synopsis is engaging and well-written, but could benefit from more detail and
  specificity. For example, what are the specific stakes of the mission? How does
  Nova plan to stop Petrov's AI system, and what obstacles will she face along the
  way? Additionally, the romantic subplot between Nova and Alex feels somewhat rushed
  and could be developed further. Overall, the synopsis has potential, but could be
  improved with more attention to detail and character development.
- "The synopsis is engaging and action-packed, but it could benefit from more character\
  \ development and a clearer explanation of Nova's motivations and the stakes. Additionally,\
  \ some of the descriptions are overly dramatic and clich\xE9d, such as the mention\
  \ of a 'diabolical plan' and a 'heart-pumping showdown'. Overall, it's a good start,\
  \ but it could be improved with more nuance and subtlety."
