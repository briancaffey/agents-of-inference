synopsis_feedback_history:
- The synopsis has a good balance of action and intrigue, but could benefit from a
  clearer focus on Agent Nova's character and motivations. The plot is overly reliant
  on coincidences and plot twists, and the supporting characters feel somewhat one-dimensional.
  Consider adding more depth and nuance to the story through character development
  and subtlety.
- Consider adding more context and background information on Agent Nova and the Baroness's
  motivations to make the synopsis more engaging and suspenseful. Additionally, the
  plot could benefit from more twists and turns to keep the reader guessing. The current
  synopsis is straightforward and lacks surprises, which may make it less compelling
  to readers.
