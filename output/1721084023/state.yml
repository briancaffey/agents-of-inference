    sd_prompt: As the night fell, a crescent moon hung in the sky above the horizon,
      casting a misty glow on the island that seemed especially foreboding. The silhouette
      of the island stood out sharply in the hazy moonlight. The camera then slowly
      zooms in, revealing a lone lighthouse on the otherwise deserted island. The
      light from the lighthouse seemed even lonelier against the barren landscape,
      and the wind rustled the tall grasses nearby, as if telling the tale of the
      island's solitude and desolation.
