synopsis_feedback_history:
- The synopsis is engaging and provides a clear overview of the plot. However, it
  would benefit from more detail on Dr. Helga Vex's character development and motivations.
  Additionally, some action sequences could be condensed to focus on the most pivotal
  moments. The romantic dinner at the end feels slightly out of place; consider integrating
  Sophia Patel's role into the main plot instead.
- "The synopsis is engaging and provides a good overview of the plot, but some areas\
  \ could be improved: 1) Adding more specific details about the characters' motivations\
  \ and backstories to make them more relatable and complex. 2) Breaking up long paragraphs\
  \ into shorter, punchier sentences to increase the pace and readability. 3) Incorporating\
  \ sensory details to help readers visualize the settings and action sequences. 4)\
  \ Avoiding clich\xE9s like the 'evil villain with a global domination plan' trope.\
  \ 5) Adding more tension and suspense to keep the reader engaged throughout the\
  \ synopsis."
