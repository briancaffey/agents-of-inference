- description: A village where people cannot speak, but they can project their thoughts
    into the air as whispers that anyone can hear. Communication becomes a delicate
    dance of subtle gestures, facial expressions, and the interpretation of distant
    echoes. Whispers can also become curses, haunting the village with negative thoughts,
    and the village council must constantly strive to keep the air clean of harmful
    thoughts.
