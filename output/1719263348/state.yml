- Consider adding more specific details about Vesper's backstory to make her character
  more relatable and engaging. Additionally, the plot could benefit from more subtle
  hints at Kairos' true intentions rather than a straightforward reveal. The romance
  subplot with Sophia should be developed further to add emotional depth to the story.
- To make this synopsis more engaging, consider adding more specific details about
  Vesper's backstory and how it affects her character development. Additionally, hinting
