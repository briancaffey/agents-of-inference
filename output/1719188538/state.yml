synopsis_feedback_history:
- The synopsis is engaging and provides a good sense of the plot, but it could benefit
  from more specificity on Agent X's character and motivations. Additionally, the
  language is somewhat generic and could be more vivid and descriptive. Finally, the
  romance subplot could be more clearly integrated into the main plot. Consider adding
  more details about Agent X's personal stake in the mission and how his relationships
  with Sophia and other characters drive the story forward.
- The synopsis focuses too much on the plot and action scenes, and lacks character
  development. Consider adding more information about the characters' motivations
  and personalities to make them more relatable and engaging.
