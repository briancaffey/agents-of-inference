  human.
- The synopsis lacks clarity and detail, making it difficult to understand the plot
  and character motivations. It feels more like a generic action movie summary than
  a compelling story. Consider adding more specific and nuanced descriptions of the
  characters' backstories and the stakes of the mission to make it more engaging.
