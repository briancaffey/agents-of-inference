synopsis_feedback_history:
- The synopsis is engaging and provides a clear overview of the plot. However, it
  could benefit from more detail about the characters' motivations and the themes
  explored. The language is descriptive, but some sentences are quite long and could
  be broken up for better clarity. The inclusion of a thrilling aerial chase at the
  end adds a sense of excitement and conclusion to the story.
- The synopsis lacks a clear sense of stakes, and the plot relies too heavily on generic
  action movie tropes. Consider adding more nuance to the characters and their motivations,
  and think about ways to subvert or complicate the familiar spy thriller plot. Additionally,
  the language is overly dramatic and cliched - try to use more specific and evocative
  descriptions to bring the setting and characters to life.
