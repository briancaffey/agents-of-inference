  sd_prompt: 'To express uncertainty, one can translate "摊手表示不确定性" into English as
    "Flopping one''s hands to indicate uncertainty."


    In this expression, "摊手" (dān shǒu) means to spread out one''s hands, which is
    a gesture often used to show that something is unclear or that the person is expressing
    confusion or disagreement about a particular topic. "表示" (bèi bù qí) means "to
    indicate" or "to show," and "不确定性" (bùdìng qíxù) translates to "uncertainty."
    So, the whole phrase describes a visual way of communicating that something is
    not clear or certain.'

  sd_prompt: 'To perform the translation task from Chinese to English, I will break
    down the sentence into its components and translate each part accordingly, then
    combine them to form a coherent English sentence.


    1. 摊手: This is a compound word in Chinese, where 摊 (tān4) means "unfold" or "spread"
    and 手 (shǒu) means "hand". So, 摊手 (tān shǒu) literally means "spread your hand"
    or "to spread your hands", which is an action used to express frustration or helplessness.


    2. 表示: This is a verb in Chinese that means "to show", "to indicate", or "to express".


    3. 无奈: This is an adjective that means "helpless" or "despondent". It is composed
    of 无 (wú), meaning "without", and 奈 (nài), a verb that means "to bear" or "to
    endure". So, 无奈 (wúnài) literally means "without (being able to) endure" or "helpless".


    Now, combining these components to form an English sentence:


    "To spread your hands as a gesture to express helplessness."


    This translation conveys the action of spreading one''s hands and the emotional
    state of being helpless or despondent.'

  sd_prompt: 'To translate the phrase "摊手表示不确定" from Chinese to English, we break
    it down into its components:


    - 摊手 (tān shǒu) - to spread one''s arms out, to gesture with one''s arms spread
    wide, or to make a gesture of helplessness or uncertainty.

    - 表示 (bì xiǎng) - to indicate, to show, or to express.

    - 不确定 (bù duì bù dìng) - uncertain, unsure, or indecisive.


    Putting it together, the translation of "摊手表示不确定" to English is "to gesture with
    one''s arms spread wide to indicate uncertainty." This phrase describes a common
    non-verbal communication gesture in which someone spreads their arms out wide,
    often accompanied by a shrug of the shoulders or a look of confusion or uncertainty,
    to express that they are unsure or unclear about something.'
