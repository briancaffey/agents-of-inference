- description: A conceptual study on the creation of buildings and sanctuaries that
    could be constructed using supercritical fluids. These could be structures that
    float in the air, dissolve and reform based on environmental conditions, or even
    self-assemble using the unique properties of supercritical fluids. This theme
    delves into the boundaries of architecture, blending technology, and the natural
    sciences to imagine a world where the physical form is not limited by gravity
    or conventional materials.
