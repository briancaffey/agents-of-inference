synopsis_feedback_history:
- The synopsis is engaging and well-paced, with a good mix of action, adventure, and
  intrigue. However, it could benefit from more specific details about Agent X's skills
  and motivations, as well as more nuanced characterization of the villain and his
  henchmen. Additionally, the inclusion of more sensory details, such as sights, sounds,
  and smells, could help to bring the setting to life and make the story feel more
  immersive. Overall, the synopsis has a lot of potential, but could be further developed
  to make it even more compelling.
- The synopsis is engaging, but could benefit from a clearer structure. Consider starting
  with a stronger sense of tension and stakes, and then gradually building the excitement
