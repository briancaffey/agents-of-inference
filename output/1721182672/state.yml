  sd_prompt: '"Hearse power? Hearsay power, is it the one who counts? The US presidential
    election, China, just a spectator."


    Please note that this translation does not accurately convey the nuances of the
    original Chinese text, especially considering the context of political commentary.
    The original text more likely would be translated as:


    "Hearse power? Having the power to speak, does that mean you get your way? The
    US presidential election, China, is just an observer."


    This translation attempts to better capture the meaning of the original text,
    which is questioning the notion of having "hearse power" or "hearse say" (a colloquial
    expression in Chinese, loosely translated as "the power to speak" or "the ability
    to influence the narrative") and its direct correlation to getting one''s way,
    particularly in reference to the US presidential election where China is mentioned
    as a country observing the event rather than a participant with significant influence.'
