  Agent Nova if he fails to foil The Architect's plan? What kind of gadgets and skills
  will he use to evade the henchmen? How does the setting of Tokyo and Cambodia add
  to the tension and action of the story? Additionally, the character descriptions
  of Agent Nova and Lena could be fleshed out to make them more relatable and interesting.
